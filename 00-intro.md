## Introduction

Welcome!

With this book, I show you how to build real-world applications in Rust which
I use daily to generate my crypto reports and manage my crypto portfolio.

So, we're not talking "Hello, world!" here. We're assuming you can write
"Hello, world!" in Rust, already.

And if you can't, then we're assuming you can go to the 
[Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) 
tutorials and learn these skills first.

This book hits hard, fast.

And how does this book hit hard, fast?

To build real-world applications in Rust, you have to be able to 1) identify
real-world problems, and 2) have the perseverance to solve real-world problems.

So 1) Identifying real-world problems.

What's a real-world problem?

"I have bought 10 $AVAX, and I wish to fund my QI-AVAX LP on Benqi Finance. How 
many $AVAX must I trade to fund this liquidity pool?"

Now, that's a really easy problem to solve, isn't it!

But can you write a Rust program that solve that problem? Can you write a Rust
program that generalizes solving that kind of problem? And others?

That's what this book is for.

But this book's aim is not to solve easy problems, or: actually it is, because
a hard problem is hard to solve, but a hard problem can be broken up into a
set of smaller problems that are eventually easy to solve.

And that's where perseverance comes in.

And that's why this book is written the way it is. And how is it written?

I pose a "hard" problem at the beginning of each chapter. Can you solve it?

I walk you through the process of solving each problem. Each problem is a 
real-world problem in cryptocurrency. When you solve the problem, you get an
insight in to my approach to crypto, but, more importantly, you get an insight
how I solve problems.

If you can solve problems, then you can do anything, right?

That's how I see it.

And that's why I'm writing this book: my gift, to you.
