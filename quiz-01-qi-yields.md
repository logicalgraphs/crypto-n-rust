## Chapter 1: Hello, world!

So, when I said we aren't going to do "Hello, world!" Why are we here doing
"Hello, world!"?

Well, it's because I'm an onery son o' a gun. Get used to it.

Okay, (relenting), it's because the "Hello, world!"-app is, well: useless. We
need to say "Hello, Johny!" or "Hello, " ... whomever we're "hello"-ing to.

Why?

"Hello, world!" is output only, non-configurable. A useless program.

But "Hello, "... whomever is both input and output and configurable.

From "Hello, geophf!" you can go in just about any direction we want to go.

Neat-o.

But before we do that, let's do our first pop-quiz.
