# Chapter 1: Hello, world!

So, when I said we aren't going to do "Hello, world!" Why are we here doing
"Hello, world!"?

Well, it's because I'm an onery son o' a gun. Get used to it.

Okay, (relenting), it's because the "Hello, world!"-app is, well: useless. We
need to say "Hello, Johny!" or "Hello, " ... whomever we're "hello"-ing to.

Why?

"Hello, world!" is output only, non-configurable. A useless program.

But "Hello, "... whomever is both input and output and configurable.

From "Hello, geophf!" you can go in just about any direction we want to go.

Neat-o.

*A note on pedagogy*

This chapter, and subsequent chapters, are split into two parts: part I 
introduces a concept (yes, like "Hello, world!"); part II addresses the quiz
preceeding the chapter and how I solve it as a *Rustacean*.

## Part I: "Hello, world!"

The Rust community [already 
provides](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello.html)  how to solve 
"Hello, world!" itself.

Go there, do that exercise, then come back when you've "Hello, world!"ed 
yourself in Rust.

But, how does one say "Hello, John!" or "Hello, Jane!" or "Hello, Jamal!"?

Aye. There's the rub!

I'm not interested in typing in: "geophf" in the shell in response to the 
prompt:

> `What is your name? _`

I don't know many people who are. This isn't a world where the `Animal`-game,
programmed in BASIC, requires interactive shell queries and responses. We're
not in that world anymore.

Thank goodness.
