So.

We have:

* trade-routes --v

![trade-routes](../quiz22/imgs/02-prime-asset-trade-routes.png)

* [asset-types and -amounts](../quiz21)
* a [buy-or-sell call with Î´](../../dApps/rekt)
* [token prices](../../dApps/gecko)

trade and a close approximation of how much we'll get from the trade.

Compute that.
