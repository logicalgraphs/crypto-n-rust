# Pivot quiz 05

## query prices on @coingecko with Rust 

Now: 

* we have the coingecko API ids and the API-key (put that in the env 
`COIN_GECKO_API_KEY` var)
* we can GET from a REST endpoint

Write a Rust program to get the prices for the tokens listed in 
[pivots.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logicalgraphs/crypto-n-rust/pivot-quiz-04/data-files/csv/pivots.csv).
