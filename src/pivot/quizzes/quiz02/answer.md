# Pivot pop-quiz 02 answer

## Libraryitizing reading a REST endpoint

You see 
[the answer](https://github.com/logicalgraphs/crypto-n-rust/blob/pivot-quiz-02-answer/src/pivot/quizzes/quiz02/answer02.rs#L12)
simply calls a 
[library function](https://github.com/logicalgraphs/crypto-n-rust/blob/pivot-quiz-02-answer/src/pivot/swerve/read_rest.rs), 
which was the functionality developed in the prior quiz.

What stitches this all together are the cargo-manifests. Explore the repository 
to get the feel of Rust libraries.
