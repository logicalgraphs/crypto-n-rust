The problem of representation.

We have a spreadsheetszorxen with LOTS of columns. What does it represent?

In this case, it's straightforward (kinda?): it represents (leveraged) trades,
particularly, in this case, from Levana and Nolus.

But leverage works in two ways: long and short.

And trades occur multiple times? Over multiple days?

And, plot-twist: Levana allows for take-profit and stop-loss executions, so,
up to now, I've (manually) executed every trade
