# COSMWASM

A step-by-step introduction to smart contracts on CØSMOS, following along
with the [book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/index.html).

I also forked the sample contracts from CØSMOS git repository and housed them
[here](cw-plus).

## Deployment

The Osmosis zone provides 
[a tutorial](https://docs.osmosis.zone/cosmwasm/testnet/cosmwasm-deployment/) 
on deploying smart contracts to their testnet.
