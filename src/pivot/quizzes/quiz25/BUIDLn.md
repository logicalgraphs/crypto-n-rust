# Pivot quiz 25 answer: dusk

## Pivot anatomy

First, let's start with the anatomy of a pivot.

What is a pivot?

Easy:

* an open pivot trade then the close pivot trade. So: two trades, basically.

Not so easy: 

* well, that's where we get to work, eh? ðŸ˜Ž 

The good news is that ./dusk need only concern itself with open pivots (close pivots are closed, so are dead ðŸ’€ to ./dusk for disposition decisions), so our parsing problem becomes monadic(/simplified):

* accept (and parse) open pivots
* reject everything else (close pivots)

Further good news is that, yes, ./dusk will eventually open and close pivots (and report on its actions of same), but that is a down-the-road problem, so we don't need to formulate open pivot, with all that pesky data marshaling, we just need simply read and parse open pivots.
